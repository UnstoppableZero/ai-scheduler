ADRs (Architectural Decision Records):

ADR 001: Local LLM vs Cloud API

Status: Accepted

Context: We need to parse natural language into structured data. Choices are a paid API like OpenAI or a local model like Ollama.

Decision: We will utilize Ollama running locally on our machines.

Consequences: The LLM used for this project will require sufficient RAM and Storage to run the model.

ADR 002: Backend Framework Selection

Status: Accepted

Context: A backend is required to handle API requests and interface with the LLM. Options include Spring Boot, FastAPI, Django, etc.

Decision: FastAPI will be utilized.

Consequences: The team has to understand Python type hinting and Pydantic models.

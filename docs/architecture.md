# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Planning hangouts with friends is annoying. Everyone has different schedules and you waste so much time texting back and forth trying to find a day that works. By the time you figure it out, people already made other plans.

## Target Users & Benefits

**Who uses it:**
- Friend groups
- College students with busy schedules
- Anyone tired of "when are you free?" texts

**How it helps:**
- Finds the best day for everyone automatically
- Saves time and stress
- Suggests random activities so you know what to do

## Solution Overview

Users upload their schedules and our AI reads them to find when everyone is free. It picks the best day for the whole group to hang out. It can also suggest a random activity for that day so you don't have to figure out what to do.

## Tech Stack

**FastAPI:** Fast and easy for building our backend and connecting the AI.

**PostgreSQL:** Good database for storing schedules and user info.

**Next.js:** Makes a clean, fast website for users to upload schedules and see results.

These tools work well together and handle everything we need.

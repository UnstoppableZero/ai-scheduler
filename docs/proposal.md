Problem Statement

Planning hangouts with friends can be a hassle since everyone has different schedules and much time is spent deciding what time works for everybody. By the time you figure it out, people already made other plans. We aim to create a scheduler app to alleviate this stress and make it so that friends can plan hangouts with ease.
